            <h2>The Culture of Chinese Food</h2>
            <p>Chinese cuisine is deeply tied to culture and symbolism. Each dish has a specific meaning, often linked to luck, prosperity, and longevity. The balance of flavors—sweet, salty, sour, and bitter—is an important principle in Chinese cooking.</p>
            <p>Food in China is also about community. Many dishes, like Hot Pot and Dim Sum, are shared among family and friends, reflecting the importance of unity and togetherness in Chinese society.</p>
