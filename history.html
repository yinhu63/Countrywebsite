        <h1>The History of China</h1>
        <p>China, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, has a history spanning over 5,000 years. From the early dynasties to modern-day China, the country has witnessed countless events that have shaped its culture, politics, and society.</p>
        <h2>Ancient China</h2>
        <p>China’s history dates back to the Xia Dynasty (2070–1600 BC), which is considered the first Chinese dynasty. The development of Chinese civilization is often marked by the invention of writing, the development of philosophy, and the creation of the Great Wall of China to protect against northern invaders.</p>
        <h2>The Qin Dynasty</h2>
        <p>The Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC) was one of the most significant periods in Chinese history. It was during this time that Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China, standardized writing, and began the construction of the Great Wall. He is also known for the Terracotta Army, which was created to protect him in the afterlife.</p>
        <h2>Modern China</h2>
        <p>After centuries of dynastic rule, China faced turmoil in the 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912. The Republic of China was formed, and later, the People's Republic of China was established in 1949 under the leadership of the Communist Party. The country has since transformed into a global superpower, blending its ancient traditions with modern innovations.</p>
